# Blood Donation Management System

Blood donation is a process where a person willingly consents to having their blood collected and used for transfusions to the human in need so that they can overcome illnesses or cancer. The blood donation becomes an essential activity among humans as it can save many lives that are in need. The blood donation involves two individuals, these are donors and recipients. Different types of donorsâ€™ blood correspond to different recipients as each of them is defined based on the presence of antigens on the surface red blood cells.

Nowadays, there are thousands of people that need donated blood so that their life can be sustained and stay healthy. Blood donation can help people based on many health conditions such as both internal and external bleeding, cancer treatment, inherited blood disorder and so on. Although there are a lot of pros, it is undoubtedly
that there must be some cons too. In physical, people may face some minor skin problems like bruising or minor swelling of skin. They might also feel fatigued or dizzy as the blood pressure is temporarily decreasing. Hence people are advised to drink water before and after the donation. Of course, there are some conditions for a person
that is not allowed to donate blood, for instance persons with health conditions such as cardiac disease, cancer and sever lung disease. A person with temporary health conditions such as pregnancy and acute fever is also prohibited from making blood donation.

Over the years, doctors and staffs have faced some hardships in managing the blood donation records as due to the data growth, lack of computerized system, and data duplication. In addition, the records are documented manually where the staff records blood donation details by just writing on paper. The handwriting might be illegible and unreadable over time as the handwriting has faded as well. Also, it is difficult and tedious to maintain the records as the records are messy and unorganized. Hence, it willbe hard for both staff and donor to understand the donation details respectively. The records of donors and staff are not secured too as the manual management of data is complicated and time-consuming. Hence the modern computerized system is ready to replace the manual-based techniques.

In this case, a simple blood donation management system is developed and designed to help the staff and donors manage the donation details that is easy but efficient way. Oracle SQL will be applied in this system as the centralized storage of database and retrieval of donor and staff records. Considering mobile gadgets are one of the mainstream gadgets for donors and staff nowadays, a system is implemented so that donors can report problems through the system. C++ would be the main interface of systems for admin, donors and staff to communicate.
